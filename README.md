## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

```js
useEffect(() => {}
```

```js
tip = tip.toFixed(2);
total = total.toFixed(2);
```

```js
const [Bill, setBill] = useState("");

onChange={(e) => setBill(e.target.value)}
```

### Continued development

- Mobile-first workflow

### Useful resources

- [React ](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html) - This helped me for using useEffect hook.
